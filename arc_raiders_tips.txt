ARC RAIDERS TIPS

General / Beginner-Friendly - Use the “Free Loadout” when starting out
or learning a map—no risk if you die. - Upgrade stamina/mobility early
to improve survivability. - Use the Safe Pocket for valuable loot or
keys. - Don’t rush fights; survival matters more than kills. - Focus on
exploration and map learning early.

Sound & Stealth - Sound is critical—footsteps and looting noises give
away position. - Crouch-walk and reduce noise whenever possible. - After
fights, stop and listen before looting.

Loadouts & Inventory - Craft custom loadouts once stable. - Prioritize
high-value loot over junk. - Use crafting benches for weapon/equipment
improvements. - Bring utility items like grenades and smokes.

Movement & Positioning - Use cover and high ground; positioning beats
aim. - Learn alternate routes to avoid ambushes. - Master map knowledge:
ARC patrols, loot, extraction points.

Extraction Tips - Extraction points are loud and risky—scout first. -
Raider Hatch Keys offer quiet extraction options. - Even while downed,
extraction may still be possible. - Extracting with decent loot is
better than dying with rare loot.

Combat & PvE/PvP - Choose fights wisely—avoid unnecessary engagements. -
Use weapons effective against armored ARC enemies. - Melee weak AI
enemies to conserve ammo and reduce noise. - Use tactical gear
proactively.

Solo Play & Mindset - Solo is viable with cautious play: awareness,
retreating, early extracts. - Don’t let gear-fear stop you—deaths are
learning moments. - Practice in low-stakes runs before bringing valuable
gear.
